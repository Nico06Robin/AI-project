Project Title: Voice-to-Text Notes for Logistics
Tech Stack: Python, OpenAI Whisper, Streamlit, Pandas, Tesseract (optional), CSV

Developed a voice-enabled logistics note-taking application that uses speech recognition to transcribe spoken shipment updates into structured text. 
The system saves voice inputs as timestamped text entries in a CSV file, making it easy for logistics teams to track and document verbal updates.

Integrated OpenAI Whisper to transcribe voice recordings with high accuracy.

Used Streamlit to build an interactive web interface for uploading audio files and viewing transcribed notes.

Automatically stored transcriptions with timestamps in a CSV using Pandas.

Enabled users to download the entire log for reporting or integration with other systems.
